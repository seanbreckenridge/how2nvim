# how2nvim

This repo is aimed at both neovim beginners who are willing to learn how to build a solid config
from scratch as well as experienced vim users who aren't familiar with lua. If you are looking for
an out-of-the-box setup that \*just works\*, you are wrong here. Instead you may have a look at the
following repositories:

-   [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
-   [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim)
-   [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)
-   [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad)

Neovim's biggest strength is arguably customization. Using a pre-built configuration as your
starting point is good to get an idea of what you _can_ do with neovim, but eventually you want to
build _your own_ config to get the most out of your editor. You can get started by installing nvim
which I explain in [the first part of this guide](./01-Installation/README.md).
